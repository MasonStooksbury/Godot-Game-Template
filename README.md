# Godot-Game-Template

In order to make things as consistent as possible we need similar settings. Most of the critical ones are changed in the `project.godot` file, but some can be configured in your editor and affect everything you work on (I think). Most of these settings are personal preference, but I'd like to think I have good reason to use them. All you need to do first is navigate to the `Editor > Editor Settings` menu to get started.

# Must haves
`Text Editor > Behavior > Files`
 - Trim Trailing Whitespace on Save: `ON`
   - This removes the random tabs and spaces at the end of lines that often shows up

# Nice to haves
`Text Editor > Appearance`
 - Show Line Length Guidelines: `OFF`
   - By default the editor has 80 and 100 character guidelines. Personally, I find them annoying

`Text Editor > Completion`
 - Idle Parse Delay: `1` or `0.5`
   - If you've used Godot a while, you'll know that there's a noticeable delay between when you type something and when Godot will complain that it's wrong or there's an error. This setting decreases that time and makes Godot feel a lot more responsive
